# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice

- **Professional and Precise**: The application communicates with clarity and efficiency. Instructions are direct, and feedback is informative. While the outcome is creative, the tool itself is a precision instrument for professionals.
- **Empowering**: Language should affirm the user's control over the AI. Use active verbs like "Generate," "Refine," and "Compose."

## Design Principles

- **Content First**: The UI should recede, allowing the generated images and video to take center stage. Dark mode is preferred to enhance media visibility.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Actions like generating a scene or adjusting a timeline clip should provide instant visual confirmation, even if the processing takes time (use skeletons/loaders).
- **Consistency**: Adhere strictly to the Tailwind CSS design tokens and Radix UI patterns to maintain a cohesive look and feel across the dashboard, editor, and settings.

## User Experience (UX) Standards

- **Non-Destructive Editing**: Users should be able to experiment freely. All major actions (scene generation, timeline edits) should be reversible or versioned.
- **Accessible by Default**: All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring keyboard navigability and screen reader support, especially for the complex timeline editor.
